# Readme for HW 5part 2 edits!

I built a blog platform using React+Redux, creating an App that could list posts, edit and show individual posts, as well as create new posts.

I had the most trouble with trying to update the state of only one input field when the state would just override my changes.

### Extra Credit
- CSS and design: Transitions, hover effects, etc.

- Input validation: If the user does not input a title, the app detects an empty field and inputs "untitled post" instead. Similarly, with empty tags and content fields, the app still generates space to enter information, and allows the user to change the fields.
